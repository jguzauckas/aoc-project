# Advent of Code Project

This project will have you complete the first day from Advent of Code across several years as practice in algorithm development. Each year of Advent of Code has a folder in this repository, with basic contents to get you up and running using your puzzle input.

See the `instructions.md` document for further instructions clarifying what you are expected to do in this document.
